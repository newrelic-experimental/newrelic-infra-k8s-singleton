## Overview

A New Relic Infrastructure deployment example for running [New Relic On-Host Integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations/) in Kubernetes.  For Kubernetes performance and state metrics, and most other use cases, customers should use the [New Relic Kubernetes integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/). The New Relic Kubernetes integration is configured to run the New Relic Infrastructure agent as a [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).  

## When to use

This Singleton should be used instead of the [New Relic Kubernetes Integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/) when:

- The On-Host Integration **does not** need to run on every Kubernetes worker node
- The On-Host Integration is connecting to an endpoint outside of the cluster (e.g. an RDS database)

## Installation

### kubectl

Create a secret containing your New Relic license (ingest) key and store it in the same namespace where your deployment will be running.

```
kubectl create secret generic newrelic-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<NR LICENSE KEY HERE> -n newrelic
```

After creating your secret, update the `configmap.yaml` and deploy the agent.

```
kubectl apply -f ./agent/. -n newrelic
```

### Helm

See docs [here](./charts/newrelic-infra-k8s-singleton).
